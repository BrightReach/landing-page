# Landing Page Project of the Udacity Nanodegree for Front End Developer

# # Summery

I was tasked with creating a landing page using the existing starter code provided by Udacity as a medium to develop the following functions.

- Build a navigation menu using only javascript.
- Create dynamic effects on the section and link whenever it is in the window's viewport.
- Have the user scrolled to the specified section when the link was click on.
